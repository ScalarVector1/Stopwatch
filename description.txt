Stopwatch is a simple mod which adds 3 diagnostic graphs the the screen, tracking the time in ticks to handle game logic, rendering, and the game's current memory useage. It is primarily intended for use by developers to be able to quicky visualize if something in the game is causing a major change in resource consumption. This is NOT a replacement for a proper performance/memory profiler like DotTrace or DotMemory! Those tools will give you much, much, much more in-depth information about your mod's resource consumption that you need to properly identify performance issues. This is just a monitor you can keep on while you develop that might set you off to wanting to run those tools.
